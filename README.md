this is my application which i am making for my senior project. It will hopefully be able to record audio, 
analyze it and then give me note values for what was recorded. I like to hum and whistle alot so hopefully
this will make it so i can make songs from just little recordings i will make here and there.
Eventually i plan to make it so the notes which are found in the recording are then printed onto a page of 
sheet music.
